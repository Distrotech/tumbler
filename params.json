{"name":"Tumbler","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.xfce.org/xfce/tumbler","body":"What is this?\r\n=============\r\n\r\nTumbler is a D-Bus service for applications to request thumbnails for\r\nvarious URI schemes and MIME types. It is an implementation of the \r\nthumbnail management D-Bus specification described on \r\n\r\n  http://live.gnome.org/ThumbnailerSpec\r\n\r\nwritten in an object-oriented fashion using GLib and GObject. Its \r\nmodular architecture makes it very flexible and useful in many\r\nsituations. It provides plugin interfaces for extending the URI schemes\r\nand MIME types for which thumbnails can be generated as well as\r\nfor replacing the storage backend that is used to store the thumbnails\r\non disk. Tumbler's functionality can also be extended via specialized\r\nthumbnailer services implemented in accordance to the thumbnail \r\nmanagement D-Bus specification.\r\n\r\n\r\nRequired packages\r\n=================\r\n\r\nTumbler depends on the following packages:\r\n\r\n  * glib-2.0 >= 2.16.0\r\n  * gio-2.0 >= 2.16.0\r\n  * gthread-2.0 >= 2.16.0\r\n  * dbus-1 >= 1.0.0\r\n  * dbus-glib-1 >= 0.72\r\n\r\nTumbler can optionally use the following packages:\r\n\r\n  * gdk-pixbuf-2.0 >= 2.14.0 (for a pixbuf thumbnailer plugin) \r\n  * FreeType 2.x (for a font thumbnailer plugin)\r\n  * libpng >= 1.2.0 (for the Thumbnail Managing Standard storage \r\n    backend, gdk-pixbuf-2.0 is also required for this)\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nThe 'INSTALL' file contains generic installation instructions. \r\n\r\n\r\nDebugging Support\r\n=================\r\n\r\nTumbler currently supports four different levels of debugging support, \r\nwhich can be setup using the configure flag `--enable-debug' (check the \r\noutput of `configure --help'):\r\n\r\n  `full'  Use this if you want to debug Tumbler to locate a bug. The\r\n    build will most probably be noticably slower. This is also\r\n    recommended for people that want to develop Tumbler stuff.\r\n\r\n  `yes'  This is the default for git snapshot builds. It adds all\r\n    kinds of checks to the code, and is therefore likely to run\r\n    slower. Use this if you want to develop for Tumbler (e.g.\r\n    writing Tumbler extensions and such).\r\n\r\n  `minimum'  This is the default for release builds, and presents the\r\n    recommended behaviour.\r\n\r\n  `no'  Disables all sanity checks. Don't use this unless you know\r\n    exactly what you do.\r\n\r\n\r\nStandards compliance\r\n====================\r\n\r\nTumbler supports and implements the following standards/specifications:\r\n\r\n  * XDG Base Directory Specification\r\n    http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html\r\n\r\n  * Thumbnail Managing Standard\r\n    http://jens.triq.net/thumbnail-spec/\r\n\r\n  * Thumbnail Management D-Bus Specification\r\n    http://live.gnome.org/ThumbnailerSpec\r\n\r\n  * File URI Specification\r\n    http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/file-uri-spec\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to report bugs?\r\n===================\r\n\r\nBugs should be reported to the Xfce bug tracking system \r\n(http://bugzilla.xfce.org, product Tumbler). You will need to\r\ncreate a bugzilla account for yourself first.\r\n\r\nPlease read the HACKING file for informaiton on where to send\r\nchanges or bugfixes for this package.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
